# New Cloud Documents for Alfred

<img src="./assets/icon-new.png" alt="New logo" width="128" height="128">

[.new](https://whats.new/) is a domain extension exclusively for performing new actions online: any act that leads to creation can have a quick and memorable .new shortcut associated with it.

This Alfred Workflow allows you to quickly create new cloud documents simply by invoking the 'new' keyword, a space, and then selecting from the list of available options.
